Accompanying (Matlab) analysis code for the behavioral data that was collected for this publication: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.08.24303392.

In this experiment, 3 human participants with tetraplegia controlled their own brain stimulation parameters to evoke sensations for their digital interaction with different virtual objects. Participants could manipulate the stimulation amplitude, frequency, biomimetic factor (the shape of the stimulation transient) and drag (the degree of stimulation overlap between different channels) of the provided intracortical microstimulation across 3 electrodes in their somatosensory cortex.

With this toolbox, you can read and analyze the collected behavioral data to replicate the results. Please start from the process_data.mat script in the main folder to choose what analysis you would like to perform.

The data is available upon reasonable request from the DABI database.
